# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is the client of a project using GraphQL (using Apollo) and React

It is written in Javascript.

You will find the server side project [here][https://github.com/mpoterie/express-graphql-server/]

The project is widely inspired by the GraphQl and React tutorial on Youtube, by The Net Ninja. Many parts of the code had to be updated (new API, new syntax, updated packages...), on both sides of the developping process.

### `npm start`
